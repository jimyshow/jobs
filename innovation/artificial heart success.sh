In 2020, Osaka University in Japan successfully completed the world's first transplant of lab-grown heart muscle tissues using iPS cell-based heart cells. The patient is now recovering, and the transplant is considered a major step forward in regenerative medicine for heart failure. Additionally, NIKKISO CO., LTD. developed the first experimental model of an artificial heart in 1960, with a dog surviving 5 hours and 30 minutes on the device. 
Elaboration:
Lab-grown heart tissue transplant:
In January 2020, Osaka University performed the world's first transplant of iPS cell-based heart muscle tissue. The lab-grown cardiomyocytes, transferred via "cell sheets," are expected to grow and regenerate blood vessels, improving cardiac function. 
Nikkiso's artificial heart:
Nikiso Co., Ltd. created the first experimental artificial heart in 1960, demonstrating its potential in animal experiments. 
Other research:
Research and development of both total and partial artificial hearts have been ongoing in Japan since 1959, with the University of Tokyo playing a key role.
